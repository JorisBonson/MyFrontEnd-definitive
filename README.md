The version on windows that has the white screen and that i need help on.

You'll need to move the "app" folder into the "src" folder. I couldn't upload them together because there were too many files.

The .idea folder was unable to be uploaded as it is considered hidden.

The .angularcli file and .editerconfig file are unable to be uploaded as the yare  considered hidden.

Every css file in the "app" folder cannot be uploaded as they are empty and github will not allow empty files to be uploaded.
